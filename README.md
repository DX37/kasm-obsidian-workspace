# kasm-obsidian-workspace

I got bored. Here's Obsidian workspace for Kasm, so Desktop app can act like it is web version.

## Using

Simply create workspace in Kasm, fill Docker Image with `ghcr.io/dx37/kasm-obsidian-workspace:main` and Docker Registry with `https://ghcr.io` and you're set for downloading and running this workspace.

You can also fill other fields like:

* Friendly Name as `Obsidian`
* Description as `A powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.`
* Thumbnail URL as Obsidian's `https://obsidian.md/apple-touch-icon.png`
* Categories as `Productivity`

Other necessary fields should be filled as you wish.
